Hello, welcome to Emote Wizard. We created this program at the TwitchCon Hackathon in 2017. It was originally supposed to be a turn based combat game where a streamer would play it and his chat would decide what spells he used in combat. Unfortunately, while both the game and our Twitch chat parser that utilizes the Twitch API are both fully functional, we have yet to connect them and make them work together.

Most of the game's images are emotes of streamers from Twitch, a video game streaming platform. We themed the game around it because we coded it at the hackathon they hosted.

Here is a gif showing some of the game:

Thank you for looking at our game!
